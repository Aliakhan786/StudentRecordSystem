🎓 Student Record Management System (C++ Internship Project Task 1)

📌 Task Overview  
This is **Task 1** of the **C++ Programming Internship**. It is a console-based system to manage student records using file handling in C++.

🎯 Objective  
To develop a simple text-based system that allows:

- Adding student records  
- Viewing all student records  
- Searching for a student by roll number  
- Updating student records  
- Deleting student records  

📁 All data is stored persistently using file handling.

🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Language**: C++  
- **Concepts**: Structures, File Handling (fstream), Functions, Binary Files  

✅ Features Implemented  
- Add new student record  
- Display all student records  
- Search student by roll number  
- Update student information  
- Delete student record  
- Proper input/output formatting  
- Developed using modular functions  
- Console-based UI only (no GUI)
